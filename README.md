# Tech Fluency Crash Course
Many people post-incarceration are encumbered by their lack of familiarity with technology. This can lead to difficulties such as friction in the workplace and exclusion from virtual opportunities like research studies. The below document outlines a proof of concept for a “Tech Fluency Crash Course” that can help teach and drill some of the fundamentals of technology.


## Curriculum
This curriculum will be taught through a daily email and text distro list (they can choose either or both), where students will learn a concept and then have to complete an activity, likely multiple times to “drill” it. The distro-course will be bookended by two group sessions. The first session will be in-person, will give an overview of basic terms (tab, window, typing) and note registration information from participants (like their location, Crash Course Buddy, computer type, phone type) so that their emails can be personalized. The last session will be a Virtual Session (intentionally conducted remotely to aptly celebrate their tech fluency!) where they will present learned skills.

### Email Distro
